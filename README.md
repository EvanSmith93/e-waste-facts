# E-Waste Facts

This is a little website I built for a school project. I've built it with Bootstrap and custom HTML/CSS. The website helps to protect people and our earth's resources by promoting the buying and selling of used electronics.

The website can be found at https://evansmith93.github.io/e-waste-facts/.
